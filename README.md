# Very basic server structure with Authentication

This project was created following the Section 5 of the _Advanced React and Redux_ course by _Stephen Grider_ on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux-tutorial/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the server in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3090](http://localhost:3090) to view it in the browser.
There's not much to see there as this is mostly backend.

You can make requests to it using something like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test the server routes and authentication.
